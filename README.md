# Hi, I'm Shafik 👋

### Data Engineer | Pipeline Builder | SQL Performance Nerd

I build production-grade data pipelines that move large volumes of messy real-world data into reliable, queryable systems.
My focus is on **scalability, reliability, and performance** — not toy datasets or demo dashboards.

Currently working on a high-throughput betting exchange platform handling tens of millions of records daily, designing Airflow workflows, optimizing SQL workloads, and improving warehouse reliability.

## 📌 Engineering Principles I Follow

✔ Pipelines must be observable and debuggable
✔ SQL should scale beyond millions of rows
✔ Data models should support history + performance (SCD where needed)
✔ Automation beats manual fixes every time
✔ Reliability matters more than fancy tools
